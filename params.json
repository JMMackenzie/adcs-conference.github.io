{"name":"Australasian Document Computing Symposium","tagline":"Details on the Australasian Document Computing Symposium.","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### About\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Steering Committee\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### History\r\n* 2013\tBrisbane\tQUT\r\n* 2012\tDunedin\tUniversity of Otago\r\n* 2011\tCanberra\tANU\r\n* 2010\tMelbourne\tUniversity of Melbourne\r\n* 2009\tSydney\tHCSNet / University of New South Wales\r\n* 2008\tHobart\tCSIRO ICT Centre\r\n* 2007\tMelbourne Zoo\tRMIT University\r\n* 2006\tBrisbane\tQueensland University of Technology\r\n* 2005\tSydney\tUniversity of Sydney\r\n* 2004\tMelbourne\tUniversity of Melbourne\r\n* 2003\tCanberra\tCSIRO ICT Centre\r\n* 2002\tSydney\tUniversity of Sydney\r\n* 2001\tCoff's Harbour\tSwinburne University\r\n* 2000\tSunshine Coast\tDSTC\r\n* 1999\tCoff's Harbour?\tSouthern Cross University\r\n* 1998\tSydney\tUniversity of Sydney\r\n* 1997\tMelbourne\tRMIT University\r\n* 1996\tMelbourne\tRMIT University\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
